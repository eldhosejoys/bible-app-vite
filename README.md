# Malayalam Bible Website Built using ReactJs

This is a malayalam bible website made using ReactJs with Vite. I have made this project available to public so you can spread the Gospel with people who read malayalam, or modify the data for your preferred audience.

From the build folder, you will find the build files to deploy the project. You may need to rebuild to make sure to get the latest updated one.
